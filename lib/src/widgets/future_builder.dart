/// Widget that builds itself based on the latest snapshot of interaction with
/// a [Future].
///
/// The [future] must have been obtained earlier, e.g. during [State.initState],
/// [State.didUpdateWidget], or [State.didChangeDependencies]. It must not be
/// created during the [State.build] or [StatelessWidget.build] method call when
/// constructing the [FutureBuilder]. If the [future] is created at the same
/// time as the [FutureBuilder], then every time the [FutureBuilder]'s parent is
/// rebuilt, the asynchronous task will be restarted.
///
/// A general guideline is to assume that every `build` method could get called
/// every frame, and to treat omitted calls as an optimization.
///
/// {@youtube 560 315 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ek8ZPdWj4Qo}
///
/// ## Timing
///
/// Widget rebuilding is scheduled by the completion of the future, using
/// [State.setState], but is otherwise decoupled from the timing of the future.
/// The [builder] callback is called at the discretion of the Flutter pipeline, and
/// will thus receive a timing-dependent sub-sequence of the snapshots that
/// represent the interaction with the future.
///
/// A side-effect of this is that providing a new but already-completed future
/// to a [FutureBuilder] will result in a single frame in the
/// [ConnectionState.waiting] state. This is because there is no way to
/// synchronously determine that a [Future] has already completed.
///
/// ## Builder contract
///
/// For a future that completes successfully with data, assuming [initialData]
/// is null, the [builder] will be called with either both or only the latter of
/// the following snapshots:
///
/// * `AsyncSnapshot<String>.withData(ConnectionState.waiting, null)`
/// * `AsyncSnapshot<String>.withData(ConnectionState.done, 'some data')`
///
/// If that same future instead completed with an error, the [builder] would be
/// called with either both or only the latter of:
///
/// * `AsyncSnapshot<String>.withData(ConnectionState.waiting, null)`
/// * `AsyncSnapshot<String>.withError(ConnectionState.done, 'some error', someStackTrace)`
///
/// The initial snapshot data can be controlled by specifying [initialData]. You
/// would use this facility to ensure that if the [builder] is invoked before
/// the future completes, the snapshot carries data of your choice rather than
/// the default null value.
///
/// The data and error fields of the snapshot change only as the connection
/// state field transitions from `waiting` to `done`, and they will be retained
/// when changing the [FutureBuilder] configuration to another future. If the
/// old future has already completed successfully with data as above, changing
/// configuration to a new future results in snapshot pairs of the form:
///
/// * `AsyncSnapshot<String>.withData(ConnectionState.none, 'data of first future')`
/// * `AsyncSnapshot<String>.withData(ConnectionState.waiting, 'data of second future')`
///
/// In general, the latter will be produced only when the new future is
/// non-null, and the former only when the old future is non-null.
///
/// A [FutureBuilder] behaves identically to a [StreamBuilder] configured with
/// `future?.asStream()`, except that snapshots with `ConnectionState.active`
/// may appear for the latter, depending on how the stream is implemented.
///
/// {@tool dartpad}
/// This sample shows a [FutureBuilder] that displays a loading spinner while it
/// loads data. It displays a success icon and text if the [Future] completes
/// with a result, or an error icon and text if the [Future] completes with an
/// error. Assume the `_calculation` field is set by pressing a button elsewhere
/// in the UI.

  ///  * [ConnectionState.waiting]: [future] is not null, but has not yet
